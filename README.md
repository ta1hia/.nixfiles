# .nixfiles

Configuration files for my NixOS setup (heavily lifted from @shazow's nixfiles)

Home-manager/user-level configuration is found under config/nixpkgs. Everything else is system-level.

./install.sh

TODO dotfiles currently mananged under my .dotfiles repo but I may move things into here.
